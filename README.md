# A(gon)Basic
A(gon)Basic is a Basic interpreter for develop und run basic programs in my own created basic. It runs on the Agon light 2 computer with MOS 1.04 RC 3 & VDP 1.04 or on Agon Console8 with MOS 2.1.0 & VDP 2.3.0.

To load and run ABasic type in MOS `LOAD ABASIC.BIN` and then `RUN`. You must be in the directory where your ABasic is.

> [!NOTE]
***ABasic at time is still in work. Some functions are still being planned and have no function yet.***

## Statements

ABasic has an extensive range of commands. You can view these in the files below.

## Vriable types

Variables can defined with an ID character. This is the last char of the vraiable name and define with type the variable is. Without a character it define the variable as integer.

|**ID**|**Type**|**Data size**|**Range**|
|------|--------|-------------|---------|
|Vertival line|Byte [^1]|1|0 - 255|
|ยง|Word [^1]|2|0 - 65535|
|%|Integer|3|0 - 16777215|
|!|Floating point [^1]|4|-1e-38 - 1e37|
|$|String|2 + Length of string|0 - 255 chars|
[^1]: This data format is not yet implemented


## Memory map

A(gon)Basic uses any memory areas. In the follow table you can see which areas are exist:

|**Adress**|**Name**|**Function**|
|----------|--------|------------|
| &40000 | ABasic.bin | A(gon)Basic itself |
| Varying | Jumps | Jump data for labels, procedures and functions |
| Varying | Variables | Data or reference for variables |
| Varying | Heap | Free memory are reserved for heap data |
